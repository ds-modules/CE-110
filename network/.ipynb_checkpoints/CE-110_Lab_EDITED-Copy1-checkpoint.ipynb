    "In this lab, we will be visualizing and analyzing water networks for specific utilities in CA. First off, we will simply visualize the network associated with you utility (i.e. the sources that lead into it). Then, we will analyze the flow of water in these networks and how they have changed over time. Finally, we will perform energy analysis calculations in order to see in more depth how the flow of water has changed and what effects this has had. At this time you should have been assigned a utility to visualize and analyze. Here is a mapping of utiliy names to their respective codes in the graphs and data.\n",

    "**Hypothesis:** The most likely cause of this phenomenon is the **drought** that dried out the state of California beginning in 2011. We can see in the original `cerritos` Table that the amount of energy it takes to tranport **one** acre field of water from the same source to the utility remains constant across years. We also observed that the increase in the amount of water being transported is not significant from 2010 to 2015 or predicted 2015 to 2015. With all of this in mind, we can conclude that the Cerritos utility must have pulled a larger proportion of its water from the water source with **higher energy costs** -- at these desperate times, the Cerritos utility had to rely more on the previously lesser used, more expensive water source to keep up with demand.\n",

    "From the ratio found by dividing total amount of energy used by the total volume of water, we can see that the ratio was significantly higher for 2015. In 2010, California consumed 1.10632 Billion kwh (kilowatt per hour) of energy to transport 6.64069 Million (units) of water. The amount of water transported in 2015 was predicted at that time to increase, so the total energy consumed was also predicted to increase by a small amount. However, the data shows that in 2015, the amount of water transported actually reduced to 4.3739 Million (units) of water, but the total energy expended increased significantly to 2.70958 Billion kwh, which is much higher than the predicted increase in energy (which also predicted that water transports would increase).\n",
