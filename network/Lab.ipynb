    "In this lab, we will be visualizing and analyzing water networks for specific utilities in CA. First off, we will simply visualize the network associated with you utility (i.e. the sources that lead into it). Then, we will analyze the flow of water in these networks and how they have changed over time. Finally, we will perform energy analysis calculations in order to see in more depth how the flow of water has changed and what effects this has had. At this time you should have been assigned a utility to visualize and analyze. Here is a mapping of utiliy names to their respective codes in the graphs and data.\n",

    "To start off the lab, we have to import some tools for us to be able to select and visualize certain utilities. These tools will build graphs for us which show which water sources and which types of water are upstream from a certain utility. The tools will also enable us to perform energy analysis on the utilities.Therefore, just run the cell and this will set up our environment (this will take a minute to run)."

    "**Hypothesis:** The most likely cause of this phenomenon is the **drought** that dried out the state of California beginning in 2011. We can see in the original `daly_city` Table that the amount of energy it takes to transport **one** acre field of water from the same source to the utility stayed the same for one source but doubled for another. Despite, this, the amount of water tranported from this more expensive source **increased** while volume transported from the less expensive source **decreased**. We also observed that the total volume of water transported was **less** in 2015 than predicted, yet the total energy cost was dramatically higher than what we saw in 2010 and Predicted 2015. \n",

To do this is simple: we simply divide the Total Energy sum column by the transmission_kwh/af sum column. This is done for you in the following code cell -- simply run the cell and observe the outputted table."
